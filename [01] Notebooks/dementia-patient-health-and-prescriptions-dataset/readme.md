# About Dataset
- Diabetic (Binary): Indicates whether a patient has been diagnosed with diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Alcohol Level (Continuous): Measures the alcohol consumption level of patients, possibly reflecting lifestyle choices.
- Heart Rate (Continuous): Denotes the number of heartbeats per minute, a critical indicator of cardiovascular health.
- Blood Oxygen Level (Continuous): The saturation of oxygen in the blood, a vital sign of respiratory function.
- Body Temperature (Continuous): The measured temperature of the body in Celsius, indicating potential fever or hypothermia.
- Weight (Continuous): The mass of the patient in kilograms, a fundamental measure of health.
- MRI Delay (Continuous): The time delay in obtaining an MRI scan, potentially indicative of the progression or severity of medical conditions.
- Prescription: The specific medication prescribed to the patient, relevant for treatment analysis.
- Dosage in mg (Continuous): The amount of medication prescribed, critical for dosage-effect studies.
- Age (Continuous): The age of the patient, an essential demographic factor.
- Education_Level: The highest level of education attained by the patient, which may correlate with health literacy.
- Dominant_Hand: Indicates the dominant hand of the patient, which could relate to neurological functions.
- Gender: The gender of the patient, a key demographic characteristic.
- Family_History: Indicates a family history of dementia, a significant risk factor.
- Smoking_Status: Reflects the patient's smoking habits, an important lifestyle indicator.
- APOE_ε4: Shows the presence of the APOE ε4 allele, a genetic variant associated with Alzheimer's disease.
- Physical_Activity: The level of physical activity of the patient, highlighting lifestyle impacts on health.
- Depression_Status: Indicates whether the patient has depression, which can be related to cognitive health.
- Cognitive_Test_Scores (Continuous): Scores from cognitive tests, direct measures of cognitive function.
- Medication_History: Records whether the patient has a history of medication use, relevant for drug interactions.
- Nutrition_Diet: Describes the patient's diet, an important health factor.
- Sleep_Quality: Assesses the quality of the patient's sleep, a critical aspect of health.
